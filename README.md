Description

In alphabetical order, by Aidan Guarniere, Cassandra Hurlbut, Jonathan Wilferd, and Weng Fei Fung. A non-fungible token (NFT) can be a digital file such as pictures, animations, audio, or video but they are not interchangeable because they are made unique by blockchain technology. Because they are unique exclusive items, they can be purchased and passed from one user to another. But what if we just want some samples? With Reprint, users can download and share Reprints of NFTs that are forever free. If you like a style, follow the artist to their actual NFT sales page. Browse trending reprints. Create a collection of your favorite reprints.
