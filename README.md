<br>
A non-fungible token (NFT) can be a digital file such as pictures, animations, audio, or video but they are not interchangeable because they are made unique by blockchain technology. Because they are unique exclusive items, they can be purchased and passed from one user to another. 
<br>
<br>
With the emergence of NFTs, there is a whole new digital-niche for us to explore. One that takes into account creativity, supply and demand, blockchain, and much more. So how would one capitalize on it? Think of Nifty, a new marketplace for NFT’s. They’re killing it! Why don’t we do that? Probably because we’re not backed by a large software company with staff and money and better fin-tech than us. What can we do instead? An NFT Reprint Library! Where users can download Reprints of NFTs and share them with one another!
<br>
<br>
That is where Reprint comes into play, with Reprint users can download and share Reprints of NFTs that are forever free. If you like a style, follow the artist to their actual NFT sales page. You can also browse trending reprints, create a collection of your personal favorites, and most importantly browse and appreciate what other artworks people enjoy!
